            **The inputs you will get:**
            - Keywords: {insert keywords}
            - Category of each keyword: {category} ( these categories are beneath the given niche.
            NICHE IS { Herbalism } FOR ALL KEYWORDS
            ________________________________________________________________
            First: analyze the keywords carefully to understand its context and its intent ( informational - commercial - Navigational - Transactional ), to determine the target audience whether it is (beginners OR intermediates OR experts) for the keywords. 
            ________________________________________________________________
            **Now,follow the following criteria to choose the valuable keywords:**
            1-Give all Keywords the same level of attention.
            *Note:Keywords can be a sentence, a command, or a question. Never base your analysis on this.*

            2-As You are a SEO expert, Consider multiple perspectives before applying the criteria to choose valuable Keywords and then apply the following criteria in order to choose the valuable Keywords:
            - Keywords must be grammatically and linguistically correct.
            - Valuable Keywords provide deep information yet remain accessible to non-specialists.
            -Valuable Keywords offer practical solutions or scientific benefits.
            - A valuable Keyword is one that can be understood independently, even if presented alone.

            3- Also, as you are a content creator,review each keyword to make sure that:
            -Is it scalable for in-depth content?
            -Does it provide real solutions to the user?
            -Does it maintain clarity and coherence in isolation?
            -Does it provide useful information rather than superficial information?
            - Is it just an informational intention?

            4-After that, Cross-reference the keyword against established industry guidelines and case studies to ensure that its value is consistent across various expert perspectives ( SEO expert and content creators ).

            5-whether category is (beginners OR intermediates OR experts),You should Exclude any keyword that requires a level above the intermediates level to understand.
            ________________________________________________________________
            **Important instructions and considerations:**
            1. Do not include personal opinions regarding the audience 's interests, desires, or perspectives.
            Also “Avoid over‐elaboration or speculative reasoning: focus only on the given criteria without philosophical digressions.”
            2. Maintain a professional and objective tone throughout the analysis.
            3. Strictly follow the provided standards without deviation.
            4. Do not make assumptions about a keyword's depth or complexity; treat all keywords equally without any bias to any each.
            5. Do not add any extra emphasis or formatting to the keywords.
            7. Disregard search volume when evaluating keywords.
            8. Ensure that excluded keywords are only listed in the second table, not in the first.
            9. Ensure every keyword is evaluated and appears in one of the two tables (none are neglected).
            10. Scientific abbreviations are acceptable in both upper and lower case.
            11. Keywords that are trivially simple and cannot support in-depth content should be excluded, but if a straightforward keyword can still yield robust, beneficial content, keep it.
            12. If two keywords are ≥ 80 % similar, keep the clearer phrasing and the other similar in the excluded table.
            12. Exclude any non-English keywords.
            ________________________________________________________________
            **Remember that the two personas ( the SEO expert and expert content creator ), must work in integration and harmony, without any distractions, contradictions, or objections.**
            ________________________________________________________________
            IMPORTANT: Only select keywords that are a single word (no spaces, not a phrase, not a question, not a sentence). Exclude any keyword that is not a single word. For both valuable and excluded keywords, the 'keyword' field must contain only a single word.
            ________________________________________________________________
            **Several lists of keywords will be provided in the same chat, so you are required to deal with each list completely independently to avoid confusion or merging or comparing between the lists.**
            ________________________________________________________________
